Ansible Role: redhat_linux_install
==================================

This Ansible role "Red Hat Linux Installation for IBM PowerVM" automates the process of installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) on IBM PowerVM logical partitions (LPARs) using a **network-based installation via TFTP boot**.

Overview
--------

This Ansible role automates the installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) on IBM PowerVM logical partitions (LPARs) using a network-based TFTP boot method. It orchestrates the entire setup process including infrastructure configuration, VM provisioning, and OS deployment.

The role is designed to handle both existing and non-existing LPAR scenarios:

- If the LPAR already exists, the user can specify the 'network_name' to attach the appropriate virtual network.
- If the LPAR does not exist, the role will automatically create one. In this case, the user must provide values for 'network_name'.Additionally user can provide 'mem', 'proc' and 'volume_size' parameter values.If these parameters are omitted, default values defined in the role's 'vars' will be used.

Note
-----

This role does not support idempotency. Re-running the playbook may result in duplicate or conflicting configurations.

Requirements
------------

To perform the installation, the following components must be configured:

- **HTTP (Repo) Server**
	- Hosts the RHEL distribution files and serves them via HTTP. 
	- This can be a dedicated server with multiple distro builds or a simple HTTP server with the required build.

- **PXE Server**
    - Runs both `tftpd` and `dhcpd` services. This role will configure these services if they are not already running.

- **LPAR (Logical Partition)**
   	- The target system where RHEL will be installed. If LPAR is not available, it will be created by using the given details

Role Workflow
-------------

- **LPAR Existence Check and Creation**
	- Checks if the LPAR already exists on the HMC.
	- If not found, creates a new LPAR with the specified network configuration and volume size.

- **MAC Address Retrieval and Formatting**
	- Retrieves the MAC address of the LPAR. 
	- Converts the MAC address into colon and hyphen formats for use in DHCP and GRUB configurations.

- **DHCP and TFTP Service Setup**
	- Checks if DHCP and TFTP services are running on the PXE server.
	- Installs and configures these services if not already running.
	- Calculates DHCP range and generates configuration using templates.

- **Kickstart File Generation**
	- Creates a kickstart file on the repository server using a Jinja2 template.

- **Boot File Preparation and GRUB Configuration**
	- Downloads required boot files from the repository server to the PXE server.
	- Creates GRUB netboot directory and configuration files.
	- Copies GRUB configuration to appropriate boot paths.

- **DHCP Configuration Updates and Reversion**
	- Adds LPAR-specific DHCP entries to the PXE server configuration.
	- Restarts DHCP service to apply changes.
	- Reverts DHCP configuration after installation.

- **Network Boot Initiation**
	- Executes 'lpar_netboot' from the HMC to initiate network boot on the LPAR.

- **Post-Installation Validation**
	- Waits for SSH availability on the LPAR.
	- Gathers system facts and prints OS distribution and version.
